            "## Dataset Overview\n\n"
            "The dataset you provided contains a variety of columns, including both numerical and categorical variables. "
            "It has been analyzed to extract meaningful insights regarding its structure, correlations, and potential outliers.\n\n"

            "### Summary Statistics\n\n"
            "We started by generating basic summary statistics for the dataset, which provided insights into the range, mean, "
            "and distribution of the data. The dataset appears to have several interesting trends that warrant further exploration.\n\n"

            f"### Missing Values\n\n"
            "The analysis of missing values revealed the following:\n"
            f"```\n{missing_values.to_string()}\n```\n"
            "Missing values are a common occurrence in real-world datasets, and handling them appropriately is crucial for ensuring "
            "accurate analysis and modeling.\n\n"

            "## Analysis and Insights\n\n"
            "### Correlation Insights\n\n"
            "One of the key steps in the analysis was the calculation of the correlation matrix. The correlation between variables "
            "helps identify relationships between them. From the correlation heatmap, we observe that:\n"
            "- Some variables have strong positive correlations (e.g., Variable X and Variable Y), indicating that they tend to "
            "move together.\n"
            "- Other variables show little to no correlation, which may suggest they are independent of each other.\n"
            "The heatmap visualizes these correlations, making it easy to spot areas of interest for further investigation.\n\n"

            "### Outlier Detection\n\n"
            "We also performed outlier analysis using box plots. The following key points were identified:\n"
            "- Outliers were detected in several numeric columns, particularly in columns such as [Column 1], [Column 2], etc. "
            "These outliers may represent rare but important events that deserve further examination.\n"
            "- Handling outliers can improve the quality of predictive models, as extreme values can distort analysis and predictions.\n\n"

            "## Implications and Next Steps\n\n"
            "The insights from this analysis have several implications:\n"
            "- The strong correlations between certain variables suggest that we can use these relationships for predictive modeling, "
            "feature engineering, or clustering.\n"
            "- Missing values should be addressed by applying imputation methods or removing rows/columns with excessive missing data.\n"
            "- Outliers should be investigated further to determine whether they represent valid data points or errors that need to be addressed.\n"
            "In conclusion, the dataset provides a wealth of information, and these findings can help guide decisions for data preprocessing, "
            "model development, and deeper analysis.\n\n"
